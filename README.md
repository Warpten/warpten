### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a (mostly) self-taught software developer; my actual degree is a MSc in Theoretical Chemistry. I started writing my first programs when I was 12. Nowadays, I regularly develop in C++, C#, Java, TypeScript, and have started picking up Rust. Here are some of my public projects that you may find of interest, including some I have contributed to.

## C++

1. [TrinityCore](https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore) is an open-source cross-platform MMORPG server framework. It uses [Boost](https://www.boost.org), [MariaDB](http://mariadb.org), [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/), [CMake](https://cmake.org/), and [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/).
2. [tactmon](https://github.com/Warpten/tactmon) is a C++20 library providing monitoring tools for Blizzard CDNs and product versions, leveraging [Boost](https://www.boost.org) (namely, Asio and Beast), with a Discord bot and HTTP server frontend backed up by an instance of PostgreSQL to allow proxyfied download of specific files off of Blizzard's CDNs. Development is ongoing.
3. [Dread](https://github.com/Warpten/Dread) is an [IDA Pro](https://hex-rays.com/) plugin designed to help static analysis of Metroid Dread. It uses IDA's own APIs as well as [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) (specifically, Clang's AST matchers) to analyze pseudocode and derive information that is then used to produce C header files, or automate reverse engineering. Development is on halt.
4. [hzdnptr](https://github.com/Warpten/hzdnptr) is an injectable DLL designed to patch offending assembly in Horizon Zero Dawn's early PC releases (`*((volatile int*)0) = 0xDEADCA7;` to be exact), which triggering during play and caused the game to crash. It uses [Boost](https://www.boost.org), minhook, [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt), [Zydis](https://github.com/zyantific/zydis) and [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog).
5. [snippetspp](https://github.com/Warpten/snippetspp) is an umbrella repository where I push code I use in some of my projects (some of which are not on GitHub). One in particular is a simple single-header command parser. None of the pieces of code here have been production-tested.
6. [vk_jenkins](https://github.com/Warpten/vk_jenkins) is an experiment in writing compute shaders to bruteforce Jenkins hashes, using Vulkan.

## C#


1. [DBClientFiles.NET](https://github.com/Warpten/DBClientFiles.NET) is a library designed to parse DBC, DB2 and derivate file formats from World of Warcraft's game client, with a focus on speed and memory efficiency, by leveraging `System.Linq.Expressions` to generate code at runtime. It is a newer version of [DBFilesClient.NET](https://github.com/Warpten/DBFilesClient.NET). Development is on halt.
2. [ADBC](https://github.com/Warpten/ADBC2) is very similar to the above, except that it interfaces with World of Warcraft's actual archive files, and provides a fully featured GUI with support for foreign keys, export to CSV, and visualization of textures referenced by DBC files. It is now outdated, due to changes to Blizzard's internal data formats and file relationships.
3. [WowSniffExplorer](https://github.com/Warpten/WowSniffExplorer) is an attempt at creating a GUI to process and analyze network dumps of World of Warcraft's protocol. It is a continuation of [WowPacketParser](https://github.com/TrinityCore/WowPacketParser), but got superceded by other solutions such as [WowDatabaseEditor](https://github.com/BAndysc/WoWDatabaseEditor).
4. [MeshViewer](https://github.com/Warpten/MeshViewer) is a .NET application able to render serverside geometry at the location of the player in World of Warcraft, by externally reading process memory. It uses [OpenTK](https://opentk.net/)
