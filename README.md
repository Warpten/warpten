### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Want to take a look at my .... less vaporware ... projects?

- [DBClientFiles.NET](https://github.com/Warpten/DBClientFiles.NET) is a library able to parse DBC, DB2 and derivative file formats from World of Warcraft, with a focus on speed and memory efficiency. Uses `System.Linq.Expressions` to generate code at runtime. This project is mostly on hold for now, as I've lost interest. [ADBC](https://github.com/Warpten/ADBC2) was a similar project, except it was a fully features GUI with support for foreign keys and game file lookup (for exemple, displaying the loading screen associated with a map)
- [MeshViewer](https://github.com/Warpten/MeshViewer) is a relatively simple .NET application able to display the serverside geometry at any location in World of Warcraft, by externally reading the memory of the game client. Uses OpenTK.
- [WowSniffExplorer](https://github.com/Warpten/WowSniffExplorer) is a program designed to analyze and consolidate network data analyzed from the server-client communication protocol of World of Warcraft in an user friendly and intuitive way.
- [hzdnptr](https://github.com/Warpten/hzdnptr) is an injected DLL intended to attempt to stabilize the early versions of Horizon: Zero Dawn's PC release, which contained a custom equivalent of `assert(false)` and triggered under some circumstances during play.
- [snippetspp](https://github.com/Warpten/snippetspp) contains some of the code I've used in different personal projets. 
  One is Brigadier, a header-only command parser implementation.
  The other is a custom implementation of a `std::variant`. It lacks move and copy constructors. This version is not final.
- [vk_jenkins](https://github.com/Warpten/vk_jenkins) An experiment with compute shaders and Vulkan to bruteforce jenkins hashes. CUDA implementations (such as [this one](https://github.com/barncastle/CASC-Bruteforcer) by barncastle) far outperforms this.
